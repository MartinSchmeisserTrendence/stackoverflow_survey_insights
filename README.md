# Project

A small project that loads, extracts, transforms and visualizes data from the StackOverflow survey. 

Closing project of the data engineering zoomcamp 2025[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main].

# Data-Source
https://survey.stackoverflow.co/


It does not seem to be possible to gather the data automatically with a script due to changing link structures.

Examples:
- https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2022.zip
- https://survey.stackoverflow.co/datasets/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2016.zip


Therefore, downloading the zip-files manually in every new year seems to be mandatory.
